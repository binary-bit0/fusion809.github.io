**Cinnamon** is an early fork of GNOME 3 developed soon after GNOME 3's release. I have used it to a moderate level extent, I have, in the past, used it as my primary desktop environment but I often give up on it because its range of extensions is somewhat more limited than those available for GNOME and KDE Plasma. Although for most users I suspect the variety of extensions will suffice. Cinnamon is a lot like its parent, GNOME 3, except unlike GNOME 3 it has a fairly "conventional" user interface that looks similar to Windows NT. Like GNOME 3 it is extended using extensions written in JavaScript (JS) and is themed using style sheets in CSS or languages that transcompile to CSS.
