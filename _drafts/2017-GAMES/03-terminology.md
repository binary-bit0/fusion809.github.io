## Terminology
Later on in this article I will be using some basic terminology and expecting you, the reader, to understand them. So in this section I will be defining this terminology for future use. 

### Board game
Board games are games played on a board (surprising eh?). Examples of such games include chess and mahjongg. 

### First-person shooter (FPS)
Games of this genre are essentially shoot-em-up games, wherein the objective is to shoot and destroy your opponents without getting destroyed in the process.

### Real-time strategy (RTS)
This genre of strategy games run in real-time, that is, there are no turns to the game you just play the game.

### Role-playing game (RPG)
These are games in which the user can adopt a role, like as a soldier, a builder, a thief, <i>etc.</i>

### Turn-based strategy (TBS)
This genre of games are played in turns, wherein each team gets an equal number of turns in which to move or otherwise play the game. An example game of this genre is chess, in which both users gets a turn each in which they can move a piece.
