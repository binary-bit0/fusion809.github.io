***Scorched3D*** is a free and open-source, extremely cross-platform, artillery strategy game. Unlike most strategy games that are either real-time or turn-based, *Scorched3D* offers users a choice between these two modes of gameplay. It also has multiplayer modes and can be run over local area networks (LAN).
