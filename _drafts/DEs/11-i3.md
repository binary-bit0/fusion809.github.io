**i3** is a lightweight, fast, highly configurable, well-documented tiling window manager for the X windowing system. It is my favourite window manager because it lightweight, fast, simple, ubiquitous and is customized using shell script (or at least a shell script-like language) and optionally Python using [i3pystatus](https://github.com/enkore/i3pystatus/). Shell script is a language I am rather fluent in, while Python is a language I know enough to get by if I need to. Rather few distributions do not have i3 in their official repositories, those that do not usually have it in an unofficial repository, however. It is also available for other *nixes like the *BSDs.
