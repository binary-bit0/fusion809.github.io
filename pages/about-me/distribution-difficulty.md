## Distribution difficulty
I have ranked the distributions I have tried by how challenging they are to set up and use on a scale from 0 to 5. 0 are beginner-friendly distributions no more challenging to set up and use than Windows. I am unaware of any distribution that is exactly 0 on this scale. 1 are beginner-friendly distributions that are usually as easy as Windows to install, but may be a little more challenging to use post-install for beginners. Ubuntu is an example of a distribution with a difficulty score of 1. 2 have automated installers and may be as easy to set up as Windows, but post-installation they are significantly more challenging to use than Windows. Usually due to things like bugs, small repositories, poor out-of-the-box support for devices with proprietary drivers and/or difficult package management. 3 have no automated installers, but have a simple installation process, are usually installed from the command-line. Initial system configuration post-install is done from the command-line. Package management is not too easy for beginners, but it also is not too complex. Alternatively some distributions may fit this category that have an installer but with very complicated package management. 4 have no automated installer and a complicated installation process and are installed from the command-line. The package manager is complicated and builds from source by default. 5 is Linux From Scratch (LFS). 

1 includes: Ubuntu and most of its derivatives like Linux Mint. Along with Chapeau, deepin, Korora, Manjaro Linux, Q4OS and Sabayon Linux. 
2 includes: CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Mageia, OpenMandriva, openSUSE and TrueOS. 
3 includes: Arch Linux, NixOS, Parabola GNU/Linux and Slackware Linux. It has an installer but its package management is complicated as it has no high-level package manager, by default, that is one that resolves dependencies, manages repositories and downloads packages automatically for you. 
4 includes: Exherbo Linux, Funtoo Linux and Gentoo Linux. 
5 is mostly just LFS.
