**awesome** is a fast, lightweight and extensively customizable dynamic window manager primarily targeted towards power users. The reason why it is primarily geared towards power users is that its customization is done with Lua, the lightweight, yet powerful, multi-paradigm scripting language. I do not understand the Lua language myself but from what I have read it is one of the easier programming languages to learn, so while awesome is definitely not suitable for programming no-hopers it may be possible for someone who does not understand Lua, that hs the time and willing to learn, to pick it up while using awesome. A tutorial for newcomers to awesome can be found [here](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/). 

### Customization
Customizing awesome is done by editing its configuration files which are written in Lua. Its primary user configuration file is {% include Layouts/path.html path="~/.config/awesome/rc.lua" puncr="." %}. On Arch Linux, at least, its default configuration file is at {% include Layouts/path.html path="/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua" puncr="." %}
