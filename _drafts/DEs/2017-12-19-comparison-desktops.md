One characteristic that sets **Linux** apart from the more popular desktop operating systems, Windows NT and macOS, is that it gives users a wide selection of **desktop environments** (DEs), **Wayland compositors** (WCs) and **window managers** (WMs) to choose from. I will collectively refer to these graphical user interfaces as desktops, to save space and time. In this post I will compare a variety of desktops with regards to the following characteristics:

* **Availability**: how easy is the desktop to obtain on the more popular Linux distributions? Is it in most of their official repositories or is it something users will have to get from third-party repositories, or will even have to manually compile or package themselves? I will assign a rating to this characteristic, out of 10. For example, 1 out of 10 will mean that you, the user, will have to build your own packages for the desktop if you want to use it. While 10 out of 10 will mean it is available from the official repositories of virtually every mainstream Linux distribution.
* **Beginner-friendliness**: is this a desktop that most users will be able to pick up and know intimately within ten minutes of playing around with it? I will rate this characteristic out of 10 as well. 
* **Customizability**: is this a desktop that is only customizable by tweaking its source code or is it designed to be customized to one's heart content? I will also rate this characteristic out of 10. 
* **Stability**: is this desktop likely to be so buggy that many users will not be even able to use the thing? I will also rate this out of 10. 
* **System resource usage (SRU)**: does this desktop use a lot of system resources like power, CPU and RAM? I will rate this out of 10, with 1 being insane levels of resource usage and 10 being hardly any usage at all. I have, in the past, performed tests to measure RAM usage but in this comparison I will just use my experience as a guide.

I will also discuss, briefly, the history of each desktop. Unfortunately, I simply do not have enough time to compare every single desktop, in particular there is a very long list of window managers available that I simply cannot completely cover. I will compare the following desktops:
