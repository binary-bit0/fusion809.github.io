**Budgie** is somewhat similar to Unity in that is essentially just GNOME with only a few components different. See Budgie uses GNOME as its foundation, with most components managed upstream by the GNOME project, but what makes Budgie different from GNOME is that they replace *some* GNOME components with their own software.
